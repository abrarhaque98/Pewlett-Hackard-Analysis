# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis 

The objective of this project was to acquire information and sort data with the use of SQL queries. The goal was to answer questions regarding employees approaching requirement at the "Pewlett Hackard" company. CSV's were provided in which they contained levels of data allowing them to be related to one another in order to perform SQL queries. The "silver tsunami" (a large retirement group within the company) was oncoming and several queries were written in an effort to assist the company in managing the effects.


### Results 

Employees approaching retirement were sorted by employee number, name, title, and date they started. That data was later sorted into a more unique dataset where it did not factor in promotions. The unique group of oncoming retirees and their titles displayed in the format in following picture.

The counts of the titles of the oncoming retirees were also displayed.

In an effort to negate the drawback from so many senior members leaving, a mentorship program for some to perhaps stay part time was considered. A query was written to see how many would be eligible basing it on their employee number, name, age, and title. The format of this was similar to that of the unique titles but had a smaller age group filter.

* A significant portion of the current staff is leaving
* A large number of staff leaving were senior staff.
* There are currently 300,024 employee's at PH.
* Only a fraction of retiring employees are eligible for the mentorship program


### Summary

When the count of employee ID's was performed on the unique titles it shows that 90,398 employees were on their way to retirement meaning just as many positions to fill most of them being senior level employees. This is roughly 30% of the companies employee count.

With the suggested age range for the eligible mentors only 1549 were eligible. This number is no where near the amount leaving. In an effort to broaden the mentorship requirements the age range could be adjusted.

If we consider employees born between 1960 and 1975 our range broadens to 117,000 eligible mentors, considering that not all may take on the position this gives a better opportunity for the company to deal with the "Silver Tsunami".
