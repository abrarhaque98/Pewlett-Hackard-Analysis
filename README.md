# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis 

The objective of this project was to acquire information and sort data with the use of SQL queries. The goal was to answer questions regarding employees approaching requirement at the "Pewlett Hackard" company. CSV's were provided in which they contained levels of data allowing them to be related to one another in order to perform SQL queries. The "silver tsunami" (a large retirement group within the company) was oncoming and several queries were written in an effort to assist the company in managing the effects.


### Results 

Employees approaching retirement were sorted by employee number, name, title, and date they started. That data was later sorted into a more unique dataset where it did not factor in promotions. The unique group of oncoming retirees and their titles displayed in the following picture.


The counts of the titles of the oncoming retirees were also displayed.

* A significant portion of the current staff is leaving
* A large number of staff leaving were senior staff.
* There are currently 300,024 employee's at PH.
* Only a fraction of retiring employees are eligible for the mentorship program

In an effort to negate the drawback from so many senior members leaving, a mentorship program for some to perhaps stay part time was considered. A query was written to see how many would be eligible basing it on their employee number, name, age, and title. The format of this was similar to that of the unique titles but had a smaller age group filter.
